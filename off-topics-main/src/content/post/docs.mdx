### Content Breakdown of the IT Off-Topics Website Starting Page

This page is a starting or landing page for a website dedicated to IT and CSE topics. Here's what each part of the page is about:

---

### 1. **Title and Favicon**

- **Title**: `"IT Off-Topics"` â€” This is the title displayed in the browser tab, letting users know they are on the IT Off-Topics website.
- **Favicon**: A small icon that appears in the browser tab beside the title. This icon is linked via the following code:

  ```html
  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="./assets/images/logoo.png" type="image/svg+xml" />
  ```

This gives the page a professional look with a recognizable logo on the browser tab.

---

### 2. **Header**

The header contains the following key elements:

- **Logo**: The text "IT-Off Topics" wrapped in an anchor tag (`<a>`), which can later be linked to the homepage or another section.
- **Navigation Bar**: Placeholder list items (`<li>`) for the website's navigation links. Currently, they are empty, but you can add links such as "Home," "About," "Contact," etc.

  ```html
  <nav class="navbar" data-navbar>
    <ul class="navbar-list">
      <li class="navbar-item"><a href="#" class="navbar-link" data-nav-link></a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
  ```

- **Menu Toggle Button**: This button is designed for mobile devices, allowing users to open or close the navigation menu. It uses icons, but they are commented out at the moment.

  ```html
  <button class="nav-toggle-btn" aria-label="Toggle menu" data-nav-toggler></button>
  ```

---

### 3. **Hero Section**

This is the most important visual part of the page, designed to grab the user's attention with a large banner and call-to-action buttons.

- **Hero Image**: Displays a banner image (`coders.png`) representing IT/CSE students or the tech theme of the website.

  ```html
  <img src="./assets/images/coders.png" />
  ```

- **Hero Title**: The heading `"IT/CSE GROUP"` is prominently displayed, indicating the two different study paths or groups available on the site.

- **Description Text**: A short paragraph under the title encourages the user to choose either the IT or CSE branch to learn more:

  ```html
  <p class="hero-text">Choose your branch, IT or CSE to learn more.</p>
  ```

- **Call-to-Action Buttons**:

  - **IT Group Button**: A button that leads to a page dedicated to the **IT Group** content (`IT.html`).
  - **CSE Group Button**: Another button that takes the user to a page focused on the **CSE Group** content (`working.html`).

  ```html
  <a href="./IT.html" class="btn btn-primary">IT Group</a> <a href="./cse.html" class="btn btn-primary2">CSE Group</a>
  ```

These buttons help users navigate quickly to their desired section (either IT or CSE).

---

### 4. **Additional Functionalities**

- **Favorite Button Placeholder**: This button is meant to allow users to "favorite" certain sections or content in the future. It currently doesn't have an icon but can be expanded with JavaScript functionality later.

  ```html
  <button class="add-to-fav" aria-label="Add to favourite" data-add-to-fav>
    <!-- Placeholder for favorite functionality -->
  </button>
  ```

---

### 5. **Footer**

The footer is at the bottom of the page and serves as the closing section, providing:

- **Copyright Notice**: It states that all rights are reserved by "IT-Off Topics" and marks the year `2024`.

  ```html
  <p class="copyright">&copy; 2024 IT-Off Topics All Rights Reserved</p>
  ```

- **Social Media Links**: Icons linked to social profiles on GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. These are represented by Ionicons (icons library). Users can follow these links to interact with the brand or organization on various platforms.

  ```html
  <ul class="social-list">
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/awkward-py" class="social-link"><ion-icon name="logo-github"></ion-icon></a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  ```

---

### 6. **JavaScript & External Resources**

The page also includes:

- **JavaScript**: Linked via a separate `script.js` file that controls interactive behavior, such as menu toggling.

  ```html
  <script src="./assets/js/script.js" defer></script>
  ```

- **Icons (Ionicons)**: Used for adding social media logos and other visual elements on the page.

  ```html
  <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ionicons@5.5.2/dist/ionicons/ionicons.esm.js"></script>
  ```

---

### **Overall Content and Purpose**

- The content is primarily focused on dividing users between two main areas of study: **IT** (Information Technology) and **CSE** (Computer Science Engineering).
- The **visual appeal** comes from the **hero section**, where an image and buttons guide users to the next step.
- **Minimal content** on the landing page emphasizes a clean and easy-to-navigate user experience.
- The page serves as the **starting point** for students or visitors interested in either IT or CSE, with navigation options to dive deeper into the respective topics.

This structure makes it easy to add future content or enhance interactivity based on your project requirements.

Here's a detailed documentation for the **IT Group Page**. This page appears after the user clicks on the "IT Group" button on the landing page.

---

## IT Group Page

This page is dedicated to students in the **IT Group**, specifically focusing on 2nd- and 3rd-year IT students. Below is an explanation of each part of the page, its content, and its purpose.

---

### 1. **Main Heading**

The main heading (`<h1>`) at the top of the page greets users with a warm welcome message, letting them know that they have entered the **IT Group** section.

```html
<h1 class="h1 hero-title3">Welcome to the IT Group!</h1>
```

- **Text**: `"Welcome to the IT Group!"`
- **Purpose**: The heading serves as the primary identifier for the page, indicating that the content is specifically for IT Group students.

- **Class (`hero-title3`)**: The class `hero-title3` is likely styled to ensure the heading is prominent and visually aligned with the site's overall design.

---

### 2. **Year Selection Buttons**

Beneath the heading, the page offers two buttons for the user to select their respective year group. These buttons serve as **navigation links** to pages dedicated to either **2nd-year IT** students or **3rd-year IT** students.

```html
<div class="button-container">
  <a href="/IT-2nd/index.html" class="btn-primary2">IT-2nd year</a>
  <a href="index.html" class="btn-primary">IT-3rd year</a>
</div>
```

- **IT-2nd Year Button**:

  - **Text**: `"IT-2nd year"`
  - **Link**: `/IT-2nd/index.html`
  - **Class (`btn-primary2`)**: The button is styled with the class `btn-primary2`, which likely provides a distinct appearance from the 3rd-year button.

- **IT-3rd Year Button**:

  - **Text**: `"IT-3rd year"`
  - **Link**: `index.html`
  - **Class (`btn-primary`)**: This button uses `btn-primary`, which is probably the same styling used for other primary buttons across the site.

- **Purpose**: These buttons act as simple, intuitive navigation points that allow students to quickly access information or resources based on their academic year.

---

### 3. **Informational Text**

Directly below the buttons, there is a paragraph of text providing additional information about the group.

```html
<p class="info-text">This group consists of IT 2nd year and 3rd year students.</p>
```

- **Text**: `"This group consists of IT 2nd year and 3rd year students."`
- **Purpose**: This text briefly explains that the IT Group is made up of students from both the 2nd and 3rd years. It's a small but useful piece of information to clarify the structure of the IT Group.

- **Class (`info-text`)**: The class `info-text` is likely used to style the paragraph, making the text easier to read and in line with the overall design of the page.

---

### **Overall Page Purpose**

- **Simple Navigation**: The page provides clear navigation options for IT students to choose their respective year group and proceed to a more detailed page about their year (2nd or 3rd year).
- **User-Friendly Design**: The structure is clean and easy to follow, with just enough information to help users make a quick decision on where to go next.

---

### **How This Page Fits into the Website**

- After selecting **IT Group** on the landing page, users are directed here.
- From here, 2nd-year and 3rd-year students can navigate to their respective sections to access relevant content, like course details, assignments, or projects.

This page functions as a **gateway** to more specific content for each year group within the IT discipline.

### IT-Off Topics Main Page

This page serves as the main navigation hub for students in the 3rd-year IT section. It allows students to access different sections relevant to their academic and extracurricular activities. Below is an overview of the sections and the purpose of the page.

      { name: 'Student Name', rollNo: '35', remark: 'Good', status: 'Clear' },
    ];

    const studentTableBody = document.getElementById('student-tbody');

    students.forEach((student) => {
      const row = document.createElement('tr');
      row.innerHTML = `<td>${student.name}</td>
         <td>${student.rollNo}</td>
         <td>${student.remark}</td>
         <td>${student.status}</td>
         <td><button onclick="showConsole('${student.name}')">Console</button></td>`;
      studentTableBody.appendChild(row);
    });
  });
</script>
```

- **Student Data**: The `students` array contains each student's data, where we have replaced the actual names with "Student Name" for privacy.
- **DOMContentLoaded Event**: This event listener ensures that the student list gets generated after the DOM has fully loaded.
- **Dynamic Table Rows**: The `students` array is looped through, creating a new table row for each student and inserting it into the `tbody` of the table.
- **Button Action**: Each student row has a "Console" button. Clicking this button logs the student's name to the console for debugging or further development purposes.

- `<h4>`: This subheading describes the purpose of the timetable, helping users understand its utility.

#### 2. **Timetable Main Section**

```html
<main style="margin: 0;">
  <div class="timetable active" id="timetable">
    <div>
      <span id="prevDay">&lt;</span>
      <h2>Today's Timetable</h2>
      <span id="nextDay">&gt;</span>
    </div>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Time</th>
          <th>Subject</th>
          <th></th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody></tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</main>
```

**Explanation**:

- `<main>`: Defines the main content area of the page. It is styled with `margin: 0` to remove default margins.
- `<div class="timetable active" id="timetable">`: Container for the timetable, including navigation for previous and next days and the timetable table.
- `<span id="prevDay">&lt;</span>` and `<span id="nextDay">&gt;</span>`: Navigation buttons for changing days. The symbols represent left and right arrows.
- `<h2>`: Displays "Today's Timetable", indicating the content that will be shown.
- `<table>`: Defines a table to display timetable data with headers for Time and Subject.

#### 1. **Data for Each Day**

```javascript
const Sunday = [
  {
    time: 'subject name',
    subject: 'time',
  },
];
// Similar structures for Monday, Tuesday, etc.
```

**Explanation**:

- `const Sunday = [...]`: Defines an array of objects for each day of the week, with `time` and `subject` placeholders. This structure will hold the actual timetable data.

#### 2. **DOM Elements and Event Handlers**

```javascript
const nextDay = document.getElementById('nextDay');
const prevDay = document.getElementById('prevDay');
```

**Explanation**:

- Selects DOM elements needed for interactions: the side menu, profile button, theme toggler, and day navigation buttons.

**Explanation**:

- Toggles the 'active' class on the side menu when the profile button is clicked, showing or hiding the menu.

#### 3. **Scroll Behavior**

```javascript
window.onscroll = () => {
  sideMenu.classList.remove('active');
  if (window.scrollY > 0) {
    document.querySelector('header').classList.add('active');
  } else {
    document.querySelector('header').classList.remove('active');
  }
};
```

**Explanation**:

- Removes the 'active' class from the side menu when scrolling. Adds or removes the 'active' class to the header based on the scroll position.

#### 4. **Set Data Function**

```javascript
let setData = (day) => {
  document.querySelector('table tbody').innerHTML = ' '; // Clear previous data
  let daylist = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];
  document.querySelector('.timetable div h2').innerHTML = daylist[day];
  switch (day) {
    case 0:
      day = Sunday;
      break;
    case 1:
      day = Monday;
      break;
    case 2:
      day = Tuesday;
      break;
    case 3:
      day = Wednesday;
      break;
    case 4:
      day = Thursday;
      break;
    case 5:
      day = Friday;
      break;
    case 6:
      day = Saturday;
      break;
  }

  day.forEach((sub) => {
    const tr = document.createElement('tr');
    const trContent = `
                            <td>${sub.time}</td>
                            <td>${sub.subject}</td>
                        `;
    tr.innerHTML = trContent;
    document.querySelector('table tbody').appendChild(tr);
  });
};
```

**Explanation**:

- `setData(day)`: Updates the timetable based on the selected day. Clears existing data and populates the table with new data by iterating over the timetable array for the selected day.

#### 5. **Navigation and Initialization**

```javascript
let now = new Date();
let today = now.getDay(); // Get the current day
let day = today; // Preserve the current day value

function timeTableAll() {
  document.getElementById('timetable').classList.toggle('active');
  setData(today);
  document.querySelector('.timetable div h2').innerHTML = "Today's Timetable";
}
nextDay.onclick = function () {
  day <= 5 ? day++ : (day = 0); // Increment day or wrap around to Sunday
  setData(day);
};
prevDay.onclick = function () {
  day >= 1 ? day-- : (day = 6); // Decrement day or wrap around to Saturday
  setData(day);
};

setData(day); // Set data for the initial load
document.querySelector('.timetable div h2').innerHTML = "Today's Timetable"; // Set heading
```

**Explanation**:

- `let now = new Date()`: Gets the current date.
- `let today = now.getDay()`: Retrieves the current day as a number (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.).
- `timeTableAll()`: Toggles the timetable section and sets the data for the current day.
- `nextDay.onclick` and `prevDay.onclick`: Update the timetable data to the next or previous day, respectively.
- `setData(day)`: Initially sets the timetable data for the page load.

### Summary

- **HTML**: Structures the timetable page with headings, navigation, and a table.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic updates to the timetable based on user interaction and the current day, including theme toggling and side menu management.

Each segment of the JavaScript code is crucial for managing the functionality of the timetable, ensuring the user can navigate between days and view the appropriate schedule.
