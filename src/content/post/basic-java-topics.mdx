## 1. Introduction to Java

### What is Java?

**Java** is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is platform-independent, which means that Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java follows the **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** principle.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Platform Independence**: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform.
  - **Object-Oriented**: Java uses the object-oriented paradigm, which helps in better code organization.
  - **Secure**: Java provides built-in security features like runtime checking and bytecode verification.
  - **Multithreaded**: Java allows multiple threads to run simultaneously, making applications faster.

### Example: A Simple Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, IT Off-topics!");
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `public class HelloWorld`: Defines a class named `HelloWorld`.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the entry point of every Java program.
- `System.out.println("Hello, IT Off-topics!");`: Prints the message to the console.

## 2. Data Types and Variables

### What are Data Types?

Data types define the type of data that a variable can hold in Java. They are categorized into two main types:
- **Primitive Data Types**: These are predefined in Java (e.g., `int`, `char`, `float`, `boolean`).
- **Non-Primitive Data Types**: These include classes, arrays, and interfaces.

### Primitive Data Types:

| Data Type | Size (bits) | Example         |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `int`     | 32          | `int x = 5;`    |
| `float`   | 32          | `float y = 5.5f;`|
| `char`    | 16          | `char z = 'A';` |
| `boolean` | 1           | `boolean isTrue = true;`|

### Variables in Java

Variables are containers that store data values. You must declare the data type of the variable before using it.

```java
int age = 20; // Declaring an integer variable 'age'
float price = 19.99f; // Declaring a float variable 'price'
```

---

## 3. Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements are used to dictate the flow of program execution. There are three main types:

### a. If-Else Statements

```java
int num = 10;
if (num > 5) {
    System.out.println("Number is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("Number is less than or equal to 5");
}
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - The `if` statement checks if the condition (`num > 5`) is true. If it is, the first block executes, otherwise the `else` block executes.

### b. Switch Statements

```java
int day = 2;
switch(day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - The `switch` statement allows multi-way branching. Depending on the value of `day`, the corresponding case will execute.

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**. In Java, it is fundamental and consists of four main principles:

### a. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding data and restricting direct access to it. It is achieved using private variables and public getter and setter methods.

```java
class Student {
    private String name; // private variable
    
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name; // public method to set name
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return name; // public method to get name
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: 
  - `private` keyword restricts access to the variable.
  - Getter and setter methods allow controlled access.

### b. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `Dog` inherits the `Animal` class and overrides the `sound()` method.

### c. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

```java
Animal a = new Dog(); // Parent class reference can hold a child class object
a.sound(); // Outputs "Dog barks"
```

### d. Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the functionality.

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw(); // abstract method
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}
```

## 5. Exception Handling

### What is Exception Handling?

Exception handling in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the flow of the program is not disrupted.

### Types of Exceptions:
1. **Checked Exceptions**: These are checked at compile time (e.g., `IOException`).
2. **Unchecked Exceptions**: These occur at runtime (e.g., `ArithmeticException`).

### Try-Catch Block Example

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will cause ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
}
```

- **Explanation**: The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception. The `catch` block handles the exception.

---

## 6. Java Collections Framework

The **Java Collections Framework** provides data structures like lists, sets, and maps to store and manipulate objects efficiently.

### Example: ArrayList

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Java");
list.add("Python");
System.out.println(list); // Outputs: [Java, Python]
```

---

## 7. Multithreading in Java

Multithreading allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program to maximize CPU usage.

### Creating a Thread by Extending Thread Class

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running.");
    }
}

MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start(); // Starts the thread
```

---

## 8. File Handling

File handling in Java allows us to read from and write to files.

### Reading a File

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;

try {
    File file = new File("filename.txt");
    Scanner reader = new Scanner(file);
    while (reader.hasNextLine()) {
        String data = reader.nextLine();
        System.out.println(data);
    }
    reader.close();
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred.");
}
```

## 9. Practice Questions

1. Write a program to check if a number is prime.
2. Create a class `Vehicle` with a method `drive`. Create a subclass `Car` that extends `Vehicle` and overrides the `drive` method.
3. Write a program to create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.
4. Create a program to handle file input/output exceptions.
