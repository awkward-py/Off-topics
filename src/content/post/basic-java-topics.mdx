## 1. What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language**. Java is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible, meaning that a program written in Java can run on any platform without the need for recompilation.

Java follows the **Write Once, Run Anywhere** (WORA) principle, which means code written on one platform will work on another platform.

---

## 2. Setting Up Java

Before you start writing code, you need to set up Java on your computer.

1. Download the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. After installation, verify the setup using this command:

```bash
java -version
```

If Java is installed, it will display the version.

## 3. Hello, World! Program

Let’s start by writing your first Java program: the **Hello, World!** program.

```java
public class ITOffTopics {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to IT Off-Topics!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **public class ITOffTopics**: Defines a class named `ITOffTopics`. In Java, every application must contain at least one class.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: This is the entry point of the program. The `main` method is where the program starts executing.
- **System.out.println**: This prints the message "Welcome to IT Off-Topics!" to the console.

---

## 4. Variables and Data Types

A **variable** is a container that holds data. In Java, every variable has a specific **data type**.

### Data Types in Java:

- **int**: Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -20)
- **double**: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, 1.23)
- **char**: Single characters (e.g., 'A', 'B')
- **String**: Sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello")
- **boolean**: True or false values

### Example:

```java
public class ITOffTopicsVariables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int totalStudents = 200;  // integer
        double averageMarks = 85.6;  // floating-point
        char grade = 'A';  // single character
        String courseName = "IT Off-Topics Course";  // string
        boolean passed = true;  // boolean
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **int totalStudents = 200**: Declares an integer variable named `totalStudents` and assigns the value 200.
- **double averageMarks = 85.6**: Declares a double (decimal) variable.
- **char grade = 'A'**: Declares a character variable.
- **String courseName = "IT Off-Topics Course"**: Declares a string variable.
- **boolean passed = true**: Declares a boolean variable.

## 5. Operators

Java provides various operators to perform operations on variables. Some of the common ones include:

### Types of Operators:
1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
2. **Comparison Operators**: Used for comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`).
3. **Logical Operators**: Used for logical operations (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

### Example:

```java
public class ITOffTopicsOperators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int students = 200;
        int newAdmissions = 30;
        int total = students + newAdmissions;  // Arithmetic operator (+)

        boolean isFull = total > 220;  // Comparison operator (>)
        boolean isAccepting = !isFull;  // Logical operator (!)
    }
}
```

## 6. Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your program.

### Types of Control Flow Statements:
1. **if-else**: Executes code based on a condition.
2. **switch**: Selects one of many code blocks to execute.
3. **ternary operator**: A shorthand for `if-else`.

### Example:

```java
public class ITOffTopicsControlFlow {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int students = 150;

        // If-else statement
        if (students > 200) {
            System.out.println("The IT Off-Topics class is full.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("We are accepting more students.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 7. Loops in Java

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times.

### Types of Loops:
1. **for loop**: Repeats code a certain number of times.
2. **while loop**: Repeats code while a condition is true.
3. **do-while loop**: Same as `while` but guarantees at least one execution.

### Example:

```java
public class ITOffTopicsLoops {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Student " + i + " registered for IT Off-Topics.");
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 8. Functions or Methods

A **function (method)** is a block of code that performs a specific task. In Java, functions must be declared within a class.

### Example:

```java
public class ITOffTopicsFunctions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int students = 200;
        int newAdmissions = 30;
        int total = addStudents(students, newAdmissions);  // Calling the method
        System.out.println("Total students: " + total);
    }

    // Method to add students
    public static int addStudents(int current, int newStudents) {
        return current + newStudents;
    }
}
```

---

## 9. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** language. OOP allows you to create objects that represent real-world entities and define their behavior.

### Four Pillars of OOP:
1. **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class).
2. **Inheritance**: One class can inherit properties from another.
3. **Polymorphism**: One function can behave differently based on the input.
4. **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details from the user.

### Example:

```java
// Class representing a student in IT Off-Topics
class Student {
    String name;
    int rollNumber;

    // Constructor
    public Student(String name, int rollNumber) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
    }

    // Method to display student information
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Student: " + name + ", Roll No: " + rollNumber);
    }
}

public class ITOffTopicsOOP {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects of the Student class
        Student student1 = new Student("Pankaj", 101);
        Student student2 = new Student("Prajwal", 102);

        // Displaying information
        student1.displayInfo();
        student2.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

## 10. Advanced Topics

### 10.1 Exception Handling

Java uses **Exception Handling** to manage runtime errors.

```java
public class ITOffTopicsException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;  // This will throw an ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        }
    }
}
```

### 10.2 Threads in Java

**Threads** allow Java to perform multiple tasks concurrently.

```java
public class ITOffTopicsThreads extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running for IT Off-Topics...");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ITOffTopicsThreads thread = new ITOffTopicsThreads();
        thread.start();  // Start the thread
    }
}
```

### 10.3 File Handling



You can also read and write files in Java.

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ITOffTopicsFileHandling {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("students.txt");
            FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(file);
            writer.write("Welcome to IT Off-Topics");
            writer.close();
            System.out.println("File written successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
        }
    }
}
```
